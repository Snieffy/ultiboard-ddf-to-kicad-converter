kiub_corrected.py -- A design's corrected source files, <name>_corrected

KIUB's copy of KIUC's kiuc_corrected.py: the two files differ only in this
note, the licence header, the default tool name and the name of the
write-test file. A change to one is made in the other too.

The original files of a design are never written. Every correction KIUC,
Refdes Reannotate or KIUB makes to a design's source files goes into one
folder next to them, <name>_corrected, where each file keeps its original
name: the folder is a complete design Ulticap and Ultiboard open as it is,
and copying its files over the originals adopts the corrections without any
renaming. Next to it are the KiCad project folder <name>_KiCad and, for
library-only conversions, <name>_lib_KiCad. CORRECTED_FOLDER.md describes
this layout and the rules below for every tool that writes to the folder.

Every tool reads each file from the folder when it is there, else the
original (the working set, CorrectedFolder.working), and writes its
corrections into the folder, so the tools build on each other whatever
order they run in. The folder's manifest, _corrected.json, records each
original as it was when it was first copied and each copy as a tool last
wrote it; from those the checks find:

  - an original changed since its copy was made or gone from disk (every
    recorded original, so a tool that doesn't read a hierarchy, like KIUB,
    sees a changed sheet too), or a sheet new to a hierarchy whose sheets
    are copied: the copies are out of date;
  - a copy changed since a tool wrote it: edited by hand, never
    overwritten unasked.

The questions those findings lead to are the callers' (CLI and GUI): this
module only finds and reports. Read-only originals are refused (is_writable):
nothing can be written next to them.

No other KIUB module needed; ask_console is the console form of the
questions, shared by the command-line tools.
