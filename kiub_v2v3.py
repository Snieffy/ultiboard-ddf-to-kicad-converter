# Absolute hard ceiling (in mil) for a single V2/V3 staircase grid step
# -- see DDFConverter._is_pairable(). An ordinary right-angle routing
# corner can coincidentally have two equal-length legs; without a cap,
# that's geometrically indistinguishable from a genuine one-step
# staircase and gets merged into a diagonal it was never meant to be,
# which can cut through nearby copper (pads, other traces) that the
# original 90-degree corner safely cleared. A real Ultiboard-drawn
# diagonal staircase only ever uses small, deliberate grid steps, so
# capping the length filters this out. Empirically derived: a genuine
# 100 mil right-angle corner with coincidentally equal legs was
# observed getting misidentified as a staircase before this cap
# existed, so 100 mil is already inside ambiguous territory rather
# than a safe ceiling -- 25 mil was chosen as a broadly reasonable
# value clear of that, with anything a genuine staircase might still
# need beyond it left to the chamfer feature instead (see
# CORNER_SLANT_LIMIT_MIL below).
#
# This ceiling is enforced unconditionally -- effective_staircase_limit_
# units() applies it to *every* source of the effective limit, including
# an explicit override from a CLI flag or the GUI's staircase-conversion
# prompt, not just the automatic default. A user correction can only
# ever move the effective limit down from this ceiling, never past it.

# DDF header's own declared default grid step -- Ultiboard draws a
# staircase along the routing grid by default, and on a densely
# populated board (SMD components, small pads, tight trace/pad
# clearance) that grid step is itself already sized to the board's own
# clearance requirements: a staircase spanning several grid steps
# between two SMD pads is exactly the geometry that, if merged into one
# long diagonal, cuts across the gap DRC needs kept clear. So a small
# declared grid genuinely means a small safe staircase-step ceiling,
# board-density-dependent in a way the fixed ceiling above can't be on
# its own -- it only ever *tightens* the ceiling, never loosens it past
# STAIRCASE_CEILING_MIL. This relies on the header's declared grid being
# correct for the whole file, which is only true if the user never
# changed Ultiboard's own routing grid mid-design without it being
# reflected in the header -- outside this tool's control to verify, so
# the GUI's staircase-conversion prompt surfaces the declared value and

        legitimately disagree -- _order_LH_LV_component walks whichever
        way the chain actually connects, regardless of which end
        happened to be recorded as p1 vs p2 -- and the rest of this
        pass assumes leaves are given in walk-consistent order
        throughout, exactly like Pass 1's own c_start/c_end already do
        for run boundaries. Using the edge's raw p1/p2 instead is a
        real, if easy to make, mistake: it silently swaps which end of
        that edge is treated as "shared with the next leaf" and which
        is treated as "this component's true outer end", so a
        corner-slant offset meant for the real shared corner lands on
        the true endpoint instead -- one that structurally should never
        be touched at all (see _apply_corner_slant's docstring) -- while
        the genuine corner never gets chamfered.

        (H/V) leaves and record how much to trim off each side.

        A diagonal leaf is never a corner-slant candidate on either
        side -- a run's own diagonal meets its stub (or a directly
        borrowed connecting segment) at 135 degrees, not 90, and is
        already exactly what the staircase-recovery feature intended;
        this pass only ever looks at two adjacent H/V leaves.

        Each corner's trim amount is capped to at most half of
        *either* adjacent leg's own full length, regardless of the
        configured limit -- for a long leg this never binds and the
        configured limit is what actually applies; for a leg shorter
        than twice the limit (e.g. a short "singlet" between two other
        corners in quick succession), its own available length caps it
        instead. See CORNER_SLANT_LIMIT_MIL's module comment for why
        this keeps the result within the original corner's own
        footprint regardless of which leg is doing the limiting.

        For a via, "within tolerance" alone isn't quite the right test:
        a short leg can have *both* its corners fall within a via's own
        radius even though the via genuinely terminates a trace at
        only one of them -- the other is just incidentally close
        because the leg itself is short. So instead of protecting
        every corner within a via's radius, only the single *closest*
        candidate corner is protected per via -- and that comparison
        includes the whole chain's own two true outer endpoints
        alongside the internal candidates, even though neither is ever
        itself a chamfer candidate (they're already safe by
        construction, never touched by this scan regardless of via
        proximity). Without that, a via whose real attachment point is
        one of those true endpoints would still end up "claiming" and
        protecting whatever internal candidate happens to be nearest to
        it -- even though the via was never actually going to be
        disconnected there at all. Only when an internal candidate is
        genuinely the closest point overall (closer than either true
        endpoint) does it get protected. Each via's radius is resolved
        for *this specific layer* via _via_radius_for_layer -- not a
        single value shared across layers, since *T0/*T1/*T2 can
        legitimately declare different pad sizes for the same code (see
        that method's own docstring). A corner at a pad needs no
        equivalent check for the same true-endpoint reason: a pad can
        only ever sit at one of those same two points.

    "found" runs a real conversion under the hood and checks its output
    for any diagonal *LT record, rather than trying to shortcut the real
    component/connectivity analysis: *LH/*LV records are stored sorted
    by column/row coordinate, not by trace or drawing order, so a
    genuine staircase's edges are not necessarily -- or even usually --
    adjacent in the file; a cheaper file-order-only heuristic can't
    reliably tell.

    Two things are deliberately forced for this detection pass alone
    (saving and restoring whatever the caller already had set, so this
    function has no lasting side effects):

    - Corner-slanting (chamfering ordinary 90-degree corners) is forced
      off. Chamfer diagonals and staircase-merge diagonals are written
      in the identical *LT record format, so without isolating this,
      "found" can't actually tell "this file has genuine staircase-drawn
      diagonals" apart from "chamfering ordinary corners happened to
      produce some diagonals too" -- confirmed on a real design file
      where corner-slant alone produced over a thousand diagonal
      records while staircase-merge, in complete isolation at the exact
      same limit, produced zero.

    - The staircase limit used for detection is forced to
      STAIRCASE_CEILING_MIL itself, independent of this file's own
      declared_grid_mil (below). If detection instead used the file's
      own declared grid, a genuinely wrong declared value (too small)
      would make "found" falsely report nothing -- exactly denying the
      one caller (the GUI's staircase dialog) that could let the user
      correct it. Confirmed on a real file: a declared grid of 8.3 mil
      found nothing in isolation, but the same file's genuine staircases
      turned out to need something closer to 25 mil. Detecting at the
      ceiling means "found" answers "could staircase-merge ever find
      anything here, under the most generous reasonable interpretation"
      -- separate from declared_grid_mil/effective_limit_mil, which
      still report this file's own actual values for the dialog to show
      and let the user correct.

    "most_common_step_mil" is the statistical mode of the per-edge
    length across every genuinely multi-step run found during this same
    detection pass (see DDFConverter.multi_step_run_lengths) -- i.e.
    what this file's real, unambiguous staircases actually used, as
    opposed to declared_grid_mil, which only reflects Ultiboard's
    default grid *setting* at whatever point the header was last
    written. If this comes out larger than declared_grid_mil, that's a
    concrete, file-specific sign the routing grid was likely changed
    after these staircases were drawn -- worth surfacing to the user as
    a warning, but deliberately never applied automatically: it's a
    single global statistic for the whole file, and a board can
    legitimately mix a small grid in one dense area with a larger one
    elsewhere, where blindly raising the effective limit to match would
    reintroduce the exact over-merging risk the ceiling exists to
    prevent, just somewhere else on the same board.
